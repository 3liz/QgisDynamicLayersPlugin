Classical fields are supported, such as the <code>title</code>, <code>description</code>, <code>categories</code>, <code>themes</code>, <code>links</code>, and the spatial properties of your data: <code>extent</code>, <code>projection</code>, etc.</p> <p>PgMetadata is not designed as a catalog application which lets you search among datasets and then download the data. It is designed to ease the use of the metadata inside QGIS, allowing to search for a data and open the corresponding layer, or to view the metadata of the already loaded PostgreSQL layers.</p> <p>By storing the metadata of the vector tables inside the database:</p> <ul> <li>QGIS can read the metadata easily by using the layer PostgreSQL connection: a dock shows the metadata for the active layer when the plugin detects metadata exists for this QGIS layer.</li> <li>QGIS can run SQL queries: you can use the QGIS locator search bar to search for a layer, and load it easily in your project.</li> </ul> <p>The administrator in charge of editing the metadata will also benefit from the PostgreSQL storage:</p> <ul> <li>PostgreSQL/PostGIS functions are used to automatically update some fields based on the table data (the layer extent, geometry type, feature count, projection, etc.).</li> <li>The metadata is saved with your data anytime you backup the database.</li> <li>You do not need to share XML files across the network or install a new catalog application to manage your metadata and allow the users to get it. Only PostgreSQL is needed.</li> </ul> <p>The plugin contains some processing algorithms to help the administrator. For example:</p> <ul> <li>a script helps to create or update the needed <code>pgmetadata</code> PostgreSQL schema and tables in your database.</li> <li>a algorithm creates a QGIS project suitable for the metadata editing. This project uses the power of QGIS to create a rich user interface allowing to edit your metadata easily (forms, relations). Why use another interface when QGIS rocks ?</li> </ul> <p>More PgMetadata features:</p> <ul> <li>Modification of the HTML template to tune the displayed metadata</li> <li>Export a metadata sheet to PDF, HTML or DCAT</li> <li>Publish the metadata as a DCAT catalog with the Lizmap Web Client module for PgMetadata. It can then be harvested by external applications (Geonetwork, CKAN)</li> <li>The data model is very close to the QGIS metadata storage and the DCAT vocabulary for compatibility.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"CHANGELOG/","title":"Changelog","text":""},{"location":"CHANGELOG/#unreleased","title":"Unreleased","text":"<ul> <li>Port to QGIS 3</li> </ul>"},{"location":"CHANGELOG/#05-2016-09-08","title":"0.5 - 2016-09-08","text":""},{"location":"CHANGELOG/#04-2015-11-15","title":"0.4 - 2015-11-15","text":""},{"location":"CHANGELOG/#03-2015-11-20","title":"0.3 - 2015-11-20","text":""},{"location":"CHANGELOG/#02-2015-10-06","title":"0.2 - 2015-10-06","text":""},{"location":"CHANGELOG/#01-2015-09-07","title":"0.1 - 2015-09-07","text":""}]}
